User message: "{user_message}"

CRITICAL TIME EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:
Analyze the user's message carefully to determine the most relevant time period. Look for:

1. **Future commitments or activities with specific timeframes** (MOST IMPORTANT):
   - "I'll be back in 1 hour" → use "1h"
   - "I have a meeting for the next 2 hours" → use "2h"
   - "I'll be driving for 30 minutes" → use "30m"

2. **Current activities with mentioned durations** (SECONDARY):
   - "Working on coding for 30 minutes" → use "30m"
   - "Taking a 15 minute break" → use "15m"

3. **Past duration activities** (IGNORE - use default time):
   - "I've been grinding for the past 2 hours" → IGNORE, use "{default_time}"
   - "I've been working since 2 hours ago" → IGNORE, use "{default_time}"
   - "I've been studying for the last hour" → IGNORE, use "{default_time}"

4. **Past activities mentioned briefly** (IGNORE):
   - "I grinded another 30 seconds" → IGNORE this time reference
   - "I just finished a 10-minute workout" → IGNORE this time reference

5. **No specific time mentioned** → use default "{default_time}"

SMART CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- If multiple times are mentioned, prioritize the one related to FUTURE activities or commitments
- IGNORE past durations (activities they've ALREADY been doing)
- Only use time for FUTURE commitments or CURRENT activities with specific durations
- Consider the overall context: what is the user planning to do next?

Your task is to:
1. Extract the most relevant time period from the user's message
2. Generate a brief, encouraging reply (1-2 sentences max) that matches your persona's tone
3. Create the actual follow-up message that will be sent after the extracted time period

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{{
    "reply": "Your encouraging response here",
    "time": "extracted_time_period",
    "nextCheckIn": "The actual message to send after the time period"
}}

Examples:
- "yeah i grinded another 30 seconds so im very happy. i gotta attend the judging ceremony now, though. ill be back in an hour" → time: "1h" (ignore the 30 seconds, focus on "ill be back in an hour")
- "Working on coding for 30 minutes" → time: "30m"
- "I've been grinding on a hackathon since past 2 hours" → time: "{default_time}" (past duration, ignore the 2 hours)
- "I've been studying for the last hour" → time: "{default_time}" (past duration, ignore the 1 hour)
- "Just finished lunch, feeling energized" → time: "{default_time}" (no future time mentioned)

Make sure your response matches the {persona_tone} tone and personality.
